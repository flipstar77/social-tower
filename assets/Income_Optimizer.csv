,"Edit the green cells with your stats.
Blue cells will show your bonuses as they'll appear in the game.

In the right you'll see 3 tables.
Top One shows your current bonuses and the bonuses after one upgrade in many different things.
The Bottom two help you decide with one to invest first, considering fastest Lab or Stone Cost.

,,,,,,"What about Black Hole and Coin Bot?
Well, Coin Bot has it's own separate cost (Medals), but I advise going for more Size than Bonus, try to keep it at 3 extra size levels than bonus.
Black Hole is a bit harder, actually, extremely harder to calculate. I'd say to go for a BH coin bonus lab whenever it's quicker than GT Duration or Standard Perk Bonus labs.
It's not a exact measure, but usually, the lab that is quicker will provide the best bonuses, so, it should work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
